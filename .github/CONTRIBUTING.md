Moderator Tasks
===============

The major task for moderators: maintain `map-data.js`, delete/correct obsolete items and add new items.

A syntactical mistake with commas, quotes or brackets does not just affect the changed item but renders the map empty.
So prepare your changes with a local copy of the [map](http:lacemap.github.io/), check the result and
paste the changed items online into [map-data.js](https://github.com/lacemap/lacemap.github.io/blob/master/map-data.js)
and check the results again.

The mayor browsers can provide clues about your mistakes with their javascript console.
In case of panic after public changes you can get the previous version with
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lacemap/lacemap.github.io/XXX/README.md`
look up the value for `XXX` with the history of the file.
